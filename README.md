# MongoDB Aggregation Error: Unexpected Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the MongoDB aggregation framework. The error message often lacks specific details, making it challenging to pinpoint the cause.

## Bug Description

The primary issue is an unexpected error during the execution of the aggregation pipeline. Potential causes include:

* Incorrect field names in the pipeline stages.
* Use of invalid aggregation operators.
* Data type mismatches in the pipeline.
* Errors in the input data.

## How to reproduce

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Establish a connection to a MongoDB database.
3.  Replace the placeholder comments in the provided code with your specific aggregation pipeline stages and data.
4.  Execute the script.  If the pipeline contains errors, an aggregation error will occur.

## Solution

Carefully review each stage of your aggregation pipeline. Check for:

* **Correct field names:** Verify that the field names used in `$match`, `$group`, `$project`, and other stages accurately reflect the field names in your MongoDB collection.
* **Valid operators:** Ensure that you are using valid MongoDB aggregation operators.  Refer to the official MongoDB documentation for a list of supported operators and their syntax.
* **Data type compatibility:**  Ensure that the data types used in each stage of the pipeline are compatible with the operators being used.
* **Input data validation:** Validate the input data in your collection before running the aggregation.
* **Logging and error handling:** Add logging statements to track the progress of the pipeline and handle errors gracefully. 

The solution file provides an example that addresses this issue by carefully checking each stage and implementing proper error handling.
